I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Alexander V. Neimark](http://sol.rutgers.edu/~aneimark/) at Rutgers University. 
My research holds significant practical implications for various energy and environmental applications. 
These spans from gas separations, energy, and gas storage on nanoporous adsorbents to carbon dioxide 
sequestration and enhanced gas recovery from shale and coal reservoirs. My present work focusses on 
theoretical studies of adsorption in two types of nanoporous materials: Metal-organic frameworks 
(MOFs) and Kerogens. I use the Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamics, Density Functional Theory and Machine learning to model the
nanoscale systems and predict their properties. Most of my simulations are run on [RASPA](https://github.com/iRASPA/RASPA2),
[LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/) and [MCCS Towhee](https://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/software).
