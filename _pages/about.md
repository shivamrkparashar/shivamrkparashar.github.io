I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Dr. Alexander V. Neimark](http://sol.rutgers.edu/~aneimark/). 
My research is practically important for energy and environmental applications 
ranging from separations, energy, and gas storage on nanoporous adsorbents to carbon dioxide 
sequestration and enhanced gas recovery from shale and coal reservoirs. My present work focusses on 
theoretical studies of adsorption in two types of nanoporous materials: Metal-Organic Frameworks 
(MOFs) and Kerogens. I use the Monte Carlo, Molecular Dynamics, Density Functional Theory and Machine learning to model the
nanoscale systems and predict their properties. I mostly run simulations on [RASPA](https://github.com/iRASPA/RASPA2),
[LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/) and [MCCS Towhee](https://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/software).
