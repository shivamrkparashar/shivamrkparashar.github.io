Currently, I am a software developer at Lam Research Corporation. My Ph.D.
in chemical engineering holds significant practical 
implications for various energy and environmental applications spanning 
from gas separations, energy, and gas storage on nanoporous adsorbents to carbon 
dioxide sequestration and enhanced gas recovery from shale and coal reservoirs. 
My work focussed on theoretical studies of adsorption in two types of nanoporous
materials: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and Kerogens. I used the Monte Carlo, 
Molecular Dynamics, Density Functional Theory and Machine learning to model the 
nanoscale systems and predict their properties.
