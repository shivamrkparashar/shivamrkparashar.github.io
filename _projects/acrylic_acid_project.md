title: Trends in Pka of Oligomers of Acrylic Acid 
description: "Oligomers of acrylic acids find diverse applications in bioseparations and catalysis.By utilizing the
thermodynamic cycle of acid deprotonation, we performed Ab initio calculations to determine the pKa of an 
acrylic acid oligomer based on its conformation, tacticity, the number of carboxylic acid groups,
and the charges on the conjugated acid-base pair. "
