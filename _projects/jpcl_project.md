title: Increased dissociation of pyruvic acid at quartz/water interface 
description: "We used a combination of electronic structure-based molecular dynamics and free energy perturbation
approaches to investigate the dissociation of pyruvic acid at interface between quartz and water. We employed the 
thermodynamics integration method to calculate the difference of free energies of acid dissociation at interface and 
bulk."
