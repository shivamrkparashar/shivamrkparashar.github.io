title: Free Energy Landscape of Trialanine in Water
description: "To examine the free energy landscape of trialanine in explicit solvent, we utilized the 
Umbrella sampling method to generate the potential of mean force (PMF) as a function of dihedral angle. 
Our results demonstrate that Umbrella sampling can provide a useful qualitative depiction of the free energy landscape."
