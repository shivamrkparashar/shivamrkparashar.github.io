title: Segregation of Granular Particles in a Rotating Drum  
description: "In the context of studying radial and axial segregation, DEM simulations were performed to simulate 
the behavior of a mixture of particles of different sizes and shapes inside a rotating cylinder. The simulations 
provide insight into the mechanism that drive the segregation which is useful in designing and optimizing processes
in pharmaceutical, food, and mining industries."
